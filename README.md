# CivilizationalTheory

three phases perspective:
pre-classical - classical - post-classical
mythological - mythological-scientific - scientific
faith - reason - science

oscillation perspective:
late roman empire = hedonistic/nihilistic/decadent
-> response = ascetic christianity, rejects hedonism

swing between ideae and sensei
idealism is integration of both

occurs historically only when ideae moves towards sensei

time of plato is a good example

how do we become integrative in sensei to ideae movement

cycles at different scales: 500 y, 5000 y etc.

each cycle has its own agenda

dark ages very important to human renewal
new forms of consciousness are born in dark ages

three schools of thought:
- culturalist (Spengler)
- spiritualist (Chardin, Aurobindo)
	- cultural theory mixed strongly with spiritual dimension
- materialist ()
- big history
	- cybernetics, complexity, evolutionary theory, emergence


4 ways of looking at the world:
- organism
- mechanism
- _
- _

# Spengler = organistic approach

civilitzations are born, grow, mature and die (~1000 years)

west: chaos bad, order good (made by god)
east: order is illusion, emptiness/chaos is real
chinese: yin/yang - integrate both
atztecs: rejects both


kast system
cities form a new estate (monarchy)
-> challenges kast system

first 500 years are decentralized (spring and summer)
- generative
last 500 years are centralised (autumn and winter)
- recycles and captures what's already there

# Toynbee

civilizations succeed each other
- collective learning over time

empires are always formed by invaders (?)

not only cycles but also linear progress throughout

if you define civilization as network of cities, civilization has never gone away
- cities keep growing
- 30 k people in mezopotemia -> 20 million people in china today

3 levels of civ:
- mezopotemian civ
- axial civs
- post-axial civs

mode A,B,C,D:
- kin based gifting system (conviviality)
- state function
- markets
- return to mode A in higher form
